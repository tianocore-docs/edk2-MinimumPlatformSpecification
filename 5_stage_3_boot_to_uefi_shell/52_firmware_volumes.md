###### Table 28 Stage III FV and Component Layout

See [Appendix: Full FV Map](10_full_maps/101_firmware_volume_layout.md "Full FV Map") for a more complete example Firmware Volume layout.

When UEFI Universal Payload is used, the Stage III is implemented by the following firmware volume:
| `Name`     | `Content`               | `Compressed` | `Parent FV` |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| FvUpl      | UEFI Universal Payload  | Yes           | None        |

Which contains a single ELF executable:
| `Binary`  | `FV` | `Components` | `Purpose` |
| --------- | ---- | ------------ | --------- |
| Stage III | FvUpl.fv | UPL.elf  | Universal payload binary which contains DXE services, dispatcher and all common drivers encapsulated in an ELF executable |
